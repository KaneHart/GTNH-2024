## Client Changes
Client changes are not a requirement and are 100% optional. They do NOT provide any important features like Plot Protection as that is fully built into the server side.

Note: Optifine is now Part of the Client. Just Delete Fastcraft 1.23 Version and rename Fastcraft 1.25 jars to .jar instead. Same with the Optifine jar from .jars to .jar.
